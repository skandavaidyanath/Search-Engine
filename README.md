# Search-Engine 
1) A search engine based on the vector space model (TF IDF) and probabilistic IR (BM 25) with recommended searches feature, autocomplete search bar using tries, spell corrections, query expansion using word2vec word embeddings, etc.
2) Recommender system was implemented using Stacked Auto-encoders. (PyTorch)
3) TF-IDF and recommender system scores were used to rank the documents. BM 25 score was used to extract the most important sentence from each document and display them in the same way Google does.
4) Recommender system ensures that people with certain interests get documents related to their interests.
5) Query expansion is done to improve the recall of the system. word2vec word embedding are used for this purpose.
6) Spell corrections and autocompletes are for ease of usage.
7) Search engine was to be extended to a factoid based question answering system.
8) Detailed report of the project is attached.
9) Important external Libraries: Gensim, PyTorch, PyMySQL
